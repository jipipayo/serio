This is a litle experiment to try to do a php wrapper to use MySql with huge database tables (logs, etc),
and search into it, not using any external software like: memcached, mongoDb, etc.


The trick is to create a table MyIsam, with a fulltext search index (OMG!) and a uuid with primary key index.

Benchmarks said we found needle in haystack in 0.003~0.004 secs against 1 Million records.


So... MyIsam is not bad at all! ;-D
